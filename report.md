# Indiana Growth to Standard Model

The Indiana Growth to Standard Model is both a model for calculating/reporting individual student growth as well as a model
for combining individual student growth for schools for the purposes of rating schools as part of the state’s A-F grading
policy. Individual student learning (i.e., student growth) is a cornerstone of Indiana’s A to F accountability system for
schools. The incorporation of growth is done in accordance with the following values:

__Value 1:__ Schools should be held accountable for individual student learning (i.e., student growth).
__Value 2:__ Individual student growth is always considered relative to Indiana State standards: a student reaching or
maintaining proficiency. This is what is meant by growth to standard.
__Value 3:__ Growth should be a distinct metric, independent of school performance status (percent proficient). The
metric should have a low correlation to performance.

## A-F and Student Growth for Schools

Combining individual student growth at the school level in a manner consistent with the above mentioned values is performed
using a growth to proficiency table There a three pieces associated with the growth to the growth to proficiency table:

* The Prior Year Status of the student. That is, where the student performed the previous year.
* The individual student growth target ranges
* The points awarded for each student based upon the prior year status and where their observed growth falls within the
target range.

The growth to proficiency table defines a set of prior year starting levels and numeric growth ranges that establish points
to be awarded to schools based upon the goal of a student reaching/maintaining proficiency.

## Subtraction is not a growth model

A common belief among users of ISTEP+ data is that one can simply subtract student scores from one grade to the next and use
those to evaluate student growth. Subtraction is what everyone learned to do in elementary schools when asked to find how
much a quantity had changed. As we’ll see, subtraction doesn’t address what we really want to look at. For the ISTEP+, there
are two problems with scale score subtraction.

1. The 2015-2016 scale is not comparable with the 2014-2015 scale. Subtracting scale scores is not possible.
2. Even when scale scores can be subtracted (as with ISTEP+ results from previous years.) One cannot evaluate growth
for students starting at different places because growth depends upon where a student starts.

The reason for 2 is often not clear until one looks more closely at a simple example. Consider two high jumpers, Anna and
Judy. Anna is a novice higher jumper and Judy is a world class competitor. Anna’s best jump in 2013 was 3 feet 6 inches and
improved to 4 feet in 2014. Judy’s best jump in 2013 was 6 feet 7 inches and improved to 6 feet 9 inches in 2014.
Simple subtraction tells us how much each changed: 6 inches for Anna and 2 inches for Judy. However comparing Anna’s 6
inch improvement to Judy’s 2 inch improvement requires care.

Though it is certainly true that 6 inches is more than 2 inches, a 6 inch improvement for a novice is not more impressive than
a 2 inch improvement for an expert. Novices generally improve a lot when starting--often referred to as beginners gains.
Understanding Anna’s and Judy’s improvement requires one to compare them to their peer’s: those whose high jumping ability is
like theirs. A 2 inch increase for an elite high jumper is remarkable whereas 6 inches for a novice is typical.

The same holds with growth in ISTEP+ test scores. Like in the high jump example, changes for lower achieving students tend to
be much larger than those for high achieving students.
